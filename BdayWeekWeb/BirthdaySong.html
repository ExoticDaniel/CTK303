    <h1>Birthday Song </h1>
    <br>
    <p>On August 10, 2003, the most notable number one song during my birthday week was: </p>

    <div  class = "MusicVideo">
    <video width="640" height="360" autoplay controls loop preload="auto" >

    </video>
    </div>
    <p>
       In the early 2000s the song "Crazy in Love" by Beyonce Feating JayZ is an energetic and confident song that's about the overwhelming
       and intoxicating feeling of falling deeply in love. This song is about embracing to lose control to passion, excitement, 
       and emotional obsession, blending boldness as the song explodes with horns instruments and with the hyper beats that included the fearless vocals that makes this song powerful, yet iconic during this era.

       This was Beyoncé first #1 song as a solo artist, marking her transition from Destiny's Child to flying solo.
