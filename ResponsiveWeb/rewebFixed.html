                <h2>Song 1: Bad Bunny - Bailie Inolvidable (Unforgettable Dance)</h2>
                <img id = "songuno" src = "images/Bad_Bunny_-_Dtmf.png" alt = "Album cover of Debí Tirar Más Fotos by Bad Bunny"> 
                <p> 
                    Even though this song is in spanish,  once fully translated you sings a beatiuful story of
                    an Unforgettable dance with some one you once loved before, even though the song yearns for that 
                    past love and praising them of that romance, the song touches the person hearts by saying, "mentras uno esta vivo uno tiene que amar los mas que pueda" which 
                    translates to "While one is alive, one should love as much one can" 
                </p>

                    Undoubtly one of my favorite songs to listen and to deciate espically during 
                    this time of valetines, I wish I could've heard this song live beceause it has such a 
                    beatiuful tone and I would replay it so many times to remind me that love 
                    is truly a beatiuful thing.

                <h2> Song 3: Zombies - Childish Gambino</h2>
                <img id = "songtres" src = "images/Childish_Gambino_-_Awaken,_My_Love.png" alt = "Album cover of Awaken, My Love! by Childish Gambino"> 
                <p>
                    I know I said undoubtly before but hear me out this is the underrated song from Awaken My Love album
                    this song should pop out like the other songs from this album like Redbone, and
                    Me and your Mama, with the guitar riffs playing on song makes this song so underrated gem 
                    mine. I think listening to it will make you understand what I'm trying to say. Without a doubt a listen!
